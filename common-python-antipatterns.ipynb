    "Anti-patterns are certain patterns in software development that are considered bad programming practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "As opposed to design patterns which are common approaches to common problems that have been formalized and are generally considered a good development practice, anti-patterns are the opposite and are undesirable.\n",
    "\n",
    "Anti-patterns make code difficult to read, hard to maintain, slow, over-engineered, unstable, prone to errors and with potential security issues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Introducing anti-patterns happens for many reasons:\n",
    "\n",
    "- absence of code review\n",
    "- a willingness to try out “cool” stuff when simple things might do the trick\n",
    "- not using the right tools (code linters and formatters to follow PEP8 conventions, docstrings generators, IDEs that support auto-completion, to name a few)\n",
    "- or simply not knowing a better alternative, which is fine as long as you learn and grow\n",
    "\n",
    "Anti-patterns can be spread into one or many of these categories:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Correctness: Anti-patterns that will literally break your code or make it do the wrong things.\n",
    " \n",
    "- Maintainability: Anti-patterns that will make your code hard to maintain or extend. \n",
    "- Readability: Anti-patterns that will make your code hard to read or understand. \n",
    "- Performance: Anti-patterns that will unnecessarily slow your code down.\n",
    "- Security: Anti-patterns that will pose a security risk to your program"
